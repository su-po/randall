# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I often find myself wanting to be notified when a website has updated, and I'm a
little to preoccupied with other things to do it manually. Therefore instead of
finding another tool to do so, I've decided to write one myself!. I introduce to
you Randall, the playground *website* snitch.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
